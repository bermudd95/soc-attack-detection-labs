# SOC Attack Detection & Incident Response Labs

This repository contains hands-on cybersecurity labs designed to simulate
real-world Security Operations Center (SOC) scenarios. The projects focus on
attack simulation, detection, incident analysis, and remediation aligned with
industry frameworks such as MITRE ATT&CK and CISA advisories.

These labs demonstrate practical experience in log analysis, threat detection,
incident response, and security documentation.

## Labs Included

### 1. SSH Brute-Force Attack Detection
Simulated an SSH brute-force attack using Hydra and analyzed authentication
logs to identify indicators of compromise, escalation patterns, and root cause.

### 2. Threat Analysis Using CISA Advisories
Performed structured threat analysis aligned with CISA alerts, assessed
vulnerability impact, and proposed remediation strategies.

### 3. Phishing Detection & Incident Response
Analyzed simulated phishing attempts, identified attack indicators, and
developed an incident response playbook and security awareness recommendations.
